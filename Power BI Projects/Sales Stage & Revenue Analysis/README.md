# The Sales Stage & Revenue Analysis Dashboards 
These dashboards for a software company that has two sales channels: direct and partner. The dashboard tracks opportunities and revenue by region, deal size, and channel.

**There are two measures of revenue**
1. Revenue: A salesperson’s estimate of what the revenue will be.
2. Factored Revenue: Calculated as revenue X probability % and is accepted as being a more-accurate predictor of actual sales revenue. Probability is determined by the deal’s current sales stage:
                   - Lead: 10%
                   -	Qualify: 20%
                   -	Solution: 40%
                   -	Proposal: 60%
                   -	Finalize: 80%

**What is our dashboard telling us?**
- In the Opportunity Count by Sales Stage bar chart, select each Sales Stage in turn to see the difference in regional count. All three regions in the Solution, Proposal, and Finalize sales stages have comparable counts. This result means we close a higher percent of deals in the Central and West regions.
- East is our biggest region, not only in opportunity count but also in revenue.
- Large opportunities generate more revenue than medium or small opportunities and most of them from the East region 
- The Opportunity Count by Partner Driven and Sales Stage and The Opportunity Count by Opportunity Size and Sales Stage charts show that most of the large opportunities are partner driven, while most of the small and medium opportunities are not.
- For partner driven businesses, average revenue for large-sized opportunities is almost double that of medium-sized opportunities. On the other hand Average revenue for small and medium businesses is comparable for both partner driven and non-partner driven business.
- The Opportunity Count and Revenue by Month and Sales Stage chart shows that January and February has a high proportion of large deals in the Finalize sales stage.
