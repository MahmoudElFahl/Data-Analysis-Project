**#HR Dashboard**
The human resources department has the same reporting model across different companies, even when they differ by industry or size. This sample looks at new hires, active employees, and employees who have left. It strives to uncover any trends in the hiring strategy. Our main objectives are to understand:
- Active & Separations Employees
- New Hire & Bad Hire 
- Biases in our hiring strategy

**##Compare Currently Active and Separations Employees Dashboard**
- The two combo charts on the left show the year-over-year change for active employees and employee separations. 
    - We have more active employees this year due to rapid hiring, but also more separations than last year.
    - In August, we had more separations compared to other months. 
- Looking at the Seps gender and age groups pie charts, we notice that most of the Seps are uder 30 years and female. 
- Most of the Seps by Separation Reasons is voluntarily and more employees over age 50 left voluntarily. 

**##New Hires Dashboard**
- The New Hire, New Hires SPLY and New Hires YoY % Change by Month combo chart shows we hired more people every month this year compared to last year. Significantly more people in some months. (From Jan to Sep)
- In New Hire Count by Region; notice we’re hiring fewer people in the East region.
- The New Hires by Age Group pie chart shows we’re hiring mainly younger people. This trend may be due to the mostly part-time nature of the jobs.
- Most of full-time jobs in the East region. Also, there is a drop in the YoY % change in the Oct and Nov for the full-time jobs.

**##Bad Hires Dashboard** 
The last area to explore is bad hires. Bad hires are defined as employees who didn’t last for more than 60 days. 
- There are more male bad hires than females, many Group A bad hires and finally less than 30 age. 
- If you look at the Bad Hire Count by Gender donut chart and different regions chart, you'll notice that the East region is the only region with more female than male bad hires.
- South region has the highest Bad Hires YoY % Change with 99.8 % and the East region has the lowest with 8.6%
