# Power BI Projects
There are my projects with using Power BI in different industries: HR, sales,...etc.

- **HR Dashboards:** 
HR Dashboards focuse on the hiring strategy for a company by analyzing new hires, active employees, and employees who have left. By exploring the data, you can find trends in voluntary separations and biases in the hiring strategy.

- **Sales & Revenue Analysis Dashboards:** 
These dashboards explore a software company's sales channel. Sales managers monitor their direct and partner sales channels by tracking opportunities and revenue by region, deal size, and channel.


- **Retail Analysis Dashboards:**
Theses dashboards analyze retail sales data of items sold across multiple stores and districts. The metrics compare this year's performance to last year's in these areas: sales, units, gross margin, and variance, as well as new store analysis.
